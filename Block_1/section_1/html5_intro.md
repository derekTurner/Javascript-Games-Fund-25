## HTML5 introduction

HTML5 is a markup language used to structure a document.

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` confirms that the file is an HTML5 document.

The `<head>` generally contains information for the browser to use, such as the `<title>`.

The `<body>` contains text to be structured and rendered onto the browser screen.

Both `<head>` and `<body>` are contained within an `<html>` element.

A number of structuring elements such as header level `<h1>` and paragraph `<p>` enclose the text to control how it is layed out.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>First Level Heading</h1>
        <p>Opening paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```


<iframe 
    height="200" 
    width="100%" 
    scrolling="no" 
    title="Hello.html" 
    src="Block_1/section_1/Hello.html" 
    frameborder="no" 
    loading="lazy" 
    allowtransparency="true" 
    allowfullscreen="true">
</iframe>
